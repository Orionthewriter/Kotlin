# Overview


I wrote the basic framework for a word guessing game using a small array of words familiar to me. I also had to learn the syntax and applications of kotlin for UI implications.

I wanted to use a language similar to one i had used before (Java). Kotlin is a fairly prominent language due to it's near universal readability for applications on phones. This and the additional stipulation of having to design UI elements would prove a good challenge.

# Development Environment

I used the android studio hedgehog IDE with a built in emulator to test how it would run in an android environment.

I used the Kotlin language with some xml to facilitate the application.
